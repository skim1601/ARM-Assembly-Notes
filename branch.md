# Branch Exchange
- In ARM assembly, you can use the "branch exchange" (``BX``) instruction to return to the calling function, this instruction will read the return address from the link register (```LR```) and branch to that address.

- You can use the "``BX LR``" instruction in combination with conditional instructions such as the "branch if equal" (``BEQ``), "branch if not equal" (``BNE``), "branch if greater than" (``BGT``), etc. to return to the calling function based on a specific condition. Here's an example:

```
main:
    ; code to set up the comparison
    cmp r1, r2
    beq return
    ; code to execute if r1 and r2 are not equal
    b end

; label to return to the main subroutine
return:
    ; code to be executed when the result is equal to zero
    bx lr

end:
    ; code to exit the program
```

- In this example, the program first uses the "``cmp``" instruction to compare the contents of two registers (``r1`` and ``r2``) and sets the condition flags (N, Z, C, and V) based on the result of the comparison. Then the program uses the "beq return" instruction to check if the zero flag (Z) is set, if it is set, the program branches to the label "return" and execute the instruction there which is the "bx lr", this will return back to the main subroutine, otherwise it will continue to execute the instructions after the beq instruction.

- You can use other conditional instructions such as "``BNE``" and "``BGT``" and also you can use the "``BL``" instruction to call a subroutine, this instruction will save the return address in the link register (``LR``) before branching to the subroutine, and you will use "``BX LR``" to return to the calling function.

- It's worth noting that the BX instruction only works with the LR register, you cannot use ``BX`` with other registers. Also, when using ``BX LR``, the program will return to the address stored in the LR, so if you want to return to a specific subroutine, you should save the address of that subroutine in the LR before calling another subroutine.

## Using 'BEQ'
- In ARM assembly, the "branch if equal" (```BEQ```) instruction is used to branch to a specific label or address if the zero flag (```Z```) is set. The zero flag is set when the result of the last instruction (usually a comparison instruction such as ```CMP```) is equal to zero.

- The argument of the ```BEQ``` instruction is the label or address to branch to. The label can be any string that represents the instruction you want to jump to, and the address is the memory location of that instruction.

- It is not possible to use the instruction ```BEQ lr``` because the ```lr``` register contains the return address of a subroutine and the ``BEQ`` instruction is not able to use a register as a parameter, it can only use a label or an address. Also, the value stored in the LR is not a constant and it can change at runtime, it's not a valid address to branch to.

- You can use the instruction ```BX lr``` to return to the calling function, this instruction will read the return address from the LR and branch to that address. This is the way to return from a subroutine if you are using the "``BL``" instruction to call it, as the BL instruction saves the return address in the LR before branching to the subroutine.

- Also, you can use the ```B``` instruction to branch to a specific label, the label can be a predefined label or a label you defined, and this will allow you to return to the previous subroutine if you know the label or the address of the instruction you want to return to.
