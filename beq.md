- In ARM assembly, the "branch if equal" (```BEQ```) instruction is used to branch to a specific label or address if the zero flag (```Z```) is set. The zero flag is set when the result of the last instruction (usually a comparison instruction such as ```CMP```) is equal to zero.

- The argument of the ```BEQ``` instruction is the label or address to branch to. The label can be any string that represents the instruction you want to jump to, and the address is the memory location of that instruction.

- It is not possible to use the instruction ```BEQ lr``` because the ```lr``` register contains the return address of a subroutine and the BEQ instruction is not able to use a register as a parameter, it can only use a label or an address. Also, the value stored in the LR is not a constant and it can change at runtime, it's not a valid address to branch to.

- You can use the instruction ```BX lr``` to return to the calling function, this instruction will read the return address from the LR and branch to that address. This is the way to return from a subroutine if you are using the "BL" instruction to call it, as the BL instruction saves the return address in the LR before branching to the subroutine.

- Also, you can use the ```B``` instruction to branch to a specific label, the label can be a predefined label or a label you defined, and this will allow you to return to the previous subroutine if you know the label or the address of the instruction you want to return to.
